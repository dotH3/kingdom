# Building a Minimalist Blog

In today's web, filled with complex frameworks and heavy JavaScript bundles, there's something refreshing about going back to basics.

## The Philosophy

Minimalism in web design isn't just about aesthetics - it's about:

1. **Performance**: Fewer resources mean faster load times
2. **Accessibility**: Simple markup is easier to navigate
3. **Maintainability**: Less code means fewer bugs
4. **Focus**: Content takes center stage

## Technical Choices

For this blog, we chose:

- **Astro** for static site generation
- **System fonts** for instant rendering
- **CSS custom properties** for theming
- **No build-time JavaScript** in the output

## The Result

A blog that loads instantly, works everywhere, and puts the focus squarely on the content where it belongs.
