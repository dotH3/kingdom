# The Art of System Fonts

Custom web fonts are everywhere, but system fonts offer unique advantages that are often overlooked.

## Benefits of System Fonts

### Performance
- No font file downloads
- Instant text rendering
- Zero layout shift

### Familiarity
Users are already accustomed to their system fonts, making your content feel native and comfortable.

### Cross-platform Excellence
Modern system font stacks look great everywhere:

```css
font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 
  "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", 
  Arial, sans-serif;
```

This gives you:
- San Francisco on macOS and iOS
- Segoe UI on Windows
- Roboto on Android
- Fallbacks for older systems

## Conclusion

Sometimes the best choice is the one that's already there.
